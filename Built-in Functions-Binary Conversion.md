# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
x=16
y=bin(x)
print(y)

## Output
![438645529-cc73d8bd-1f06-4dd6-8a69-192091247bb4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e6ab8f49-bf89-4fcf-8e55-3bd74d03bdd3)

## Result
Thus, the python program was executed successfully
